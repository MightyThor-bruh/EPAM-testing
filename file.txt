whatever happened to the young young lovers?
one got shot, and another got lost in dr*gs and punks 
and bl**d on the street
bl**d on her knees
bl**dy history
<BR>
whatever happened to the hayloft?
burned to the ground
and what about pop?
he took his ass back to the crack shack
with his long johns on, singing that old song

an eye for an eye
a leg for a leg
a shot in the heart doesn't make it unbreak
----------------------------------------------------
she really didn't wanna make it messy
she really didn't wanna but the girl gone cray
